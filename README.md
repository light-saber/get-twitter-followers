##A Novel Method to get more followers by favoriting tweets from a particular hashtag

There are times when we need followers from a particular field or those who have similar interests. Random following of such twitter handles may or may not help in increasing the number of followers. The problem with following too many people is that your twitter feed will be filled with their tweets, which may not be of interest sometimes. The problem with retweeting is that it will lead to too many tweets from the user and that may not be considered good. But when we favourite a tweet, its not made public and slowly but steadily it will help in increasing the followers.

Since this is a legitimate way of increasing followers, it needs some input from the user too. They must also tweet once in a while on those topics using relevant hashtags. This way you can create a pseudo-conversation where the other person thinks you are reading his tweets but that is never the case. This way slowly, but steadily you will increase the number of followers.

This is know to work best when you use the hashtags pertaining to certain events/conference.
